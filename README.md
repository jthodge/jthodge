**Hi there, I'm Taylor**

I like tools, the nourishing Web, and abstractions that empower those that interface with them. I wonder what it means to create beautiful software.
And I think that how we currently build software—and as a result, the software that we're building—is leaving a lot on the table. Related: I believe that apps were an evolutionary mistake.
Let's build less centralized and more powerful, sophisticated tools so that people are able to construct their own environments.

I have a [personal site](https://taylorhodge.me/), and I also maintain [a growing list of TILs](https://til.taylorhodge.me/) as well.
I'm on twitter [@jtaylorhodge](https://twitter.com/jtaylorhodge) but I'm not there much these days.
